# Modeling (Formal and Otherwise)

Tic-tac-toe. 

what would it mean to model the game? 

## What is "Modeling"?

Other engineering; real applications

SW/HW: simulink ($$$), TLA+ 
Alloy. Forge ~= Alloy for edu. 

Value of modeling by itself. Is modeling a waste of time? 
Sometimes, sure; let's be realists. But often, no. Benefits... (e.g., discovering bad assumptions, making communication more clear, even generating tests. All without even running the model! And Forge lets us run the model.)

Modeling example: TTT

Exercise: family tree, own-grandpa, sudoku, ...

(Do we want to defer finite traces? perhaps)
