# Welcome! 

Welcome to Logic for Systems! Here are a few reminders about how to use this book.

With JavaScript enabled, the table of contents will allow you to select a specific chapter. Likewise, the search icon should allow you to search for arbitrary words throughout all the notes. The lecture indexing is for Spring 2024. 

~~~admonish warning title="These notes are not final!" 
This outline is subject to change, and notes are often modified in response to TA feedback or student Q&A before class. Some notes will be greyed out and inaccessible in the table of contents.

## Exercises

Exercises are enclosed in expandable spoiler tags:

~~~admonish note title="Exercise Answers"
If you see an expandable piece of text, like this:
<details>
<summary>Think, then click.</summary>

Text for you to read _after_ thinking or doing an exercise...

</details>
</br>
stop and think, or do the related exercise, before expanding.

## Spoilers

1710 is built to be inclusive. We've got first year students and grad students in the same classroom. Depending on which courses you've taken in the past, you might seen some of the ideas we'll discover today (or on other days) already. If that's the case, _avoid giving spoilers_, and don't dismiss the value of review.
