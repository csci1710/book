# Tim Notes

In modeling lecture, reinforce that modeling is nothing new. Show example from 16, 112, 18. (e.g., climate modeling)
Our modeling is a bit different. 



### 

Organize around industrial topics? Or technologies?

- state abstraction early
- inductive proof


### 

Modeling vs. Verification vs. Correct-by-construction: make this explicit! 
  Can't learn good taste in 2nd two until seen first
  

### 

Abstraction choices




## Homeworks

Identify the richness and fun and put it back in



river-crossing correspondence back on menu 

follow up with Prim/Kruskal correspondence (model the 2 algs in CLASS, make them answer same weights always, and are the two producing the same potential sets of answers up to nondeterminism? what would we do if not lockstep?)

how can we use P + K lockstep viz to talk about the invariants and how they differ?
