# 2023.13: Modeling Boolean Logic (Sets and Semantics)

###### tags: `Tag(sp23)`

Last time we started modeling boolean formulas in Forge. We'd defined what a "well-formed" formula was, and then ran Forge to produce an example with `run {wellformed}`.

That's prone to giving very small examples, though, so how about this?
```alloy
run {
  wellformed
  some top: Formula | {
    all other: Formula | top != other => {
      subFormulaOf[other, top]
    }
  }
} for exactly 8 Formula
```

Note this is an example of why we wrote a `subFormulaOf` predicate: it's convenient for re-use! If we wrote a bunch of tests that looked like this, and then added more, we wouldn't have to remember to add the new field to a bunch of separate places.

## Modeling the _Meaning_ Of Boolean Circuits

What's the _meaning_ of a formula? So far they're just bits of syntax. Sure, they're pretty trees, but we haven't defined a way to understand them or interpret them. 

This distinction is _really_ important, and occurs everywhere we use a language (natural, programming, modeling, etc.). Let's go back to that BST example:

```java=
if(this.getLeftChild() != null && this.getLeftChild().value < goal) { 
    ... 
}
```

Suppose that the BST class increments a counter whenever `getLeftChild()` is called. If it's zero before this `if` statement runs, what will it be afterward?

<details>
<summary>Think, then click!</summary>
It depends! If the left-child is non-null, the counter will hold `2` afterward. but what if the left-child is null? 
    
If we're working in a language like Java, which "short circuits" conditionals, the counter would be `1` since the second branch of the `&&` would never need to execute. 
    
But in another language, one that _didn't_ have short-circuiting conditionals, the counter might be `2`. 
</details>
<br/>

If we don't know the _meaning_ of that `if` statement and the `and` within it, we don't actually know what will happen! Sure, we have an intuition---but when you're learning a new language, experimenting to check your intuition is a good idea. Syntax can mislead us. 

So let's understand the meaning, the _semantics_, of boolean logic. What can I _do_ with a formula? What's it meant to enable? 

<details>
<summary>Think, then click!</summary>
If I have a formula, I can plug in various values into its variables, and see whether it evaluates to true or false for those values.  

So let's think of a boolean formula like a function from variable valuations to boolean values. 
</details>
<br/>

There's many ways to model that, but notice there's a challenge: what does it mean to be a function that maps _a variable valuation_ to a boolean value? Let's make a new `sig` for that: 

```alloy
-- If we were talking about Forge's underlying boolean 
-- logic, this might represent an instance! More on that soon.
sig Valuation {
  -- [HELP: what do we put here? Read on...]
}
```

We have to decide what field a `Valuation` should have. And then, naively, we might start out by writing a _recursive_ predicate or function, kind of like this pseudocode:

```alloy
pred semantics[f: Formula, val: Valuation] {
  f instanceof Var => val sets the f var true
  f instanceof And => semantics[f.a_left, val] and semantics[f.a_right, val]
  ...
}
```

This _won't work!_ Forge is not a recursive language. We've got to do something different.

Let's move the recursion into the model itself, by adding a mock-boolean sig: 

```alloy
one sig Yes {}
```
and then adding a new field to our `Formula` sig (which we will, shortly, constrain to encode the semantics of formulas):

```alloy
   satisfiedBy: pfunc Valuation -> Yes
```

This _works_ but it's a bit verbose. It'd be more clean to just say that every formula has a _set_ of valuations that satisfy it. So I'm going to use this opportunity to start introducing sets in Forge. 

#### Language change!

First, let's change our language from `#lang forge/bsl` to `#lang forge`. 

#### Adding sets...

Now, we can write:

```alloy
abstract sig Formula {
  -- Work around the lack of recursion by reifying satisfiability into a field
  -- f.satisfiedBy contains an instance IFF that instance makes f true.
  -- [NEW] set field
  satisfiedBy: set Valuation
}
```

and also:

```alloy
sig Valuation {
  trueVars: set Var
}
```

And we can encode the semantics as a predicate like this:

```alloy
-- IMPORTANT: remember to update this if adding new fmla types!
-- Beware using this fake-recursion trick in general cases (e.g., graphs)
pred semantics
{
  -- [NEW] set difference
  all f: Not | f.satisfiedBy = Valuation - f.child.satisfiedBy
  -- [NEW] set comprehension, membership
  all f: Var | f.satisfiedBy = {i: Valuation | f in i.trueVars}
  -- [NEW] set union
  all f: Or  | f.satisfiedBy = f.o_left.satisfiedBy + f.o_right.satisfiedBy
  -- [NEW] set intersection
  all f: And | f.satisfiedBy = f.a_left.satisfiedBy & f.a_right.satisfiedBy
}
```

There's a lot going on here, but if you like the idea of sets in Forge, some of these new ideas might appeal to you. However, there are some _Forge_ semantics questions you might have. 

<details>
<summary>Wait, was that a joke?</summary>
No, it actually wasn't! Are you sure that you know the _meaning_ of `=` in Forge now? 
</details>
<br/>

Suppose I started explaining Forge's set-operator semantics like so:

* Set union (`+`) in Forge produces a set that contains exactly those elements that are in one or both of the two arguments. 
* Set intersection (`&`) in Forge produces a set that contains exactly those elements that are in both of the two arguments.
* Set difference (`-`) in Forge produces a set that contains exactly those elements of the first argument that are not present in the second argument.
* Set comprehension (`{...}`) produces a set containing exactly those elements from the domain that match the condition in the comprehension.


That may sound OK at a high level, but you shouldn't let me get away with _just_ saying that. (Why not?) 

<details>
<summary>Think, then click!</summary>
What does "produces a set" mean? And what happens if I use `+` (or other set operators) to combine a set and another kind of value? And so on... 
</details>
<br/>

We're often dismissive of semantics---you'll hear people say, in an argument, "That's just semantics!" (to mean that the other person is being unnecessarily pedantic and quibbling about technicalities, rather than engaging). But especially when we're talking about computer languages, precise definitions _matter a lot_! 

Here's the vital high-level idea: **in Forge, all values are sets.** A singleton value is just a set with one element, and `none` is the empty set. 

This means that `+`, `&`, etc. and even `=` are well-defined, but that our usual intuitions (sets are different from objects) start to break down when we add sets into the language. This is one of the major reasons we started with Froglet, because otherwise the first month of 1710 is a lot of extra work for people who haven't yet taken 0220, or who are taking it concurrently.

From now on, we'll admit that everything in Forge is a set, but introduce the ideas that grow from that fact gradually, resolving potential confusions as we go.

#### Returning to well-formedness

Now we have a new kind of ill-formed formula: one where the `semantics` haven't been properly applied. So we enhance our `wellformed` predicate:

```alloy
pred wellformed {
  -- no cycles
  all f: Formula | not subFormulaOf[f, f]
  -- the semantics of the logic apply
  semantics
}
```


## Some Validation

Here are some examples of things you might check in the model. Some are validation of the model (e.g., that it's possible to have instances that disagree on which formulas they satisfy) and others are results we might expect after taking a course like 0220.

```alloy
test expect {
  nuancePossible: {
    wellformed
    -- [NEW] set difference in quantifier domain
    --   Question: do we need the "- Var"?
    some f: Formula - Var | {
      some i: Valuation | i not in f.satisfiedBy
      some i: Valuation | i in f.satisfiedBy
    }

    }
  } for 3 Formula, 1 Valuation is sat

    wellformed 
    some f: Not | {
      -- [NEW] set membership (but is it "subset of" or "member of"?)
